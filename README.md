## General info
Exeter Expedition is a web app that allows users to navigate their way around the Streatham Campus of Exeter University to orientate themselves on their first week of university. Before students arrive at campus they have already been allocated into ‘tutor groups’ which provides the basis for the teams used in the app. The central aim of Exeter Expedition is to give new students an insight into university life and culture whilst providing practical information they will need to know throughout their time at university. Furthermore, it aims to get students talking amongst each other in their tutor group in an engaging medium.
