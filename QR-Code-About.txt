Information about qr-code.html

1. qr-code.html is simply an html file that contains a bit of JavaScript to allow for the
   scanning of QR codes.
2. The important part to include is the <script> tag in the head of the file that links to
   some JavaScript hosted in a GitHub repo. This link pulls the raw JS from GitHub.

3. The value returned by scanning a QR code is stored as text (I believe in the variable
   scannedText).
4. Just about anything can be modified if needed, besides the JavaScript.
